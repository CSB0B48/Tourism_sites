            <h2>Taj Mahal – A Symbol of Eternal Love</h2>
            <p>
                The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, is one of the most iconic monuments in the world. Built by 
                Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal stands as a timeless symbol 
                of love, devotion, and architectural brilliance. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is one of the most 
                visited tourist attractions globally.
            </p>
            <h2>History of the Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p>
                The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 after the death of Mumtaz Mahal, Shah Jahan’s favorite wife. It took 
                over 20 years and the efforts of 20,000 artisans to complete this magnificent structure. Built using white marble from 
                Makrana, Rajasthan, the Taj Mahal is a masterpiece of Mughal architecture, blending elements of Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles.
                <br>
                Shah Jahan spent his final years imprisoned by his son Aurangzeb in the Agra Fort, where he is said to have gazed at the Taj Mahal 
                from a distance until his death. Today, the Taj Mahal houses the tombs of both Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan in its central chamber.
