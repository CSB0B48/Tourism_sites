            <h2>Vrindavan – The Land of Lord Krishna</h2>
            <p>
                Vrindavan, located in Uttar Pradesh, India, is one of the holiest pilgrimage sites for Hindus. It is believed 
                to be the place where Lord Krishna spent his childhood, performing divine pastimes (leelas) with his beloved 
                Radha and the gopis. Known for its temples, spiritual aura, and devotion-filled streets, Vrindavan attracts 
                millions of devotees and tourists every year.
            </p>
