            <h2>Agra Fort – A Majestic Mughal Fortress</h2>
            <p>
                Agra Fort, also known as the Red Fort of Agra, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most remarkable Mughal 
                forts in India. Located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, it stands as a symbol of power, grandeur, and architectural brilliance. 
                Built primarily with red sandstone, the fort served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors before the capital 
                shifted to Delhi.
