            <h2>Mahakumbh Mela – The Largest Spiritual Gathering on Earth</h2>
            <p>
                The Mahakumbh Mela is the largest religious gathering in the world, held every 12 years at four sacred locations 
                in India: Prayagraj (Allahabad), Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik. Millions of devotees, saints, and pilgrims from 
                across the world gather to take a holy dip in the sacred rivers, believing it cleanses them of sins and grants salvation (moksha).

            <h2>Significance of the Mahakumbh Mela</h2>
            <p>
                Significance of the Mahakumbh Mela
                The Kumbh Mela has deep spiritual and mythological importance in Hinduism. According to legend, during the cosmic war between devas (gods) and asuras 
                (demons), a few drops of the nectar of immortality (Amrit) fell at four locations—Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik. Since then, these places 
                have become sacred, and the Mahakumbh Mela is celebrated there.
                <br>
                It is believed that bathing in the Ganges, Yamuna, Saraswati, Shipra, or Godavari Rivers during the Mahakumbh Mela washes away sins and leads to spiritual enlightenment.
